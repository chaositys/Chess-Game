# Chess-Game
this is a chess game i worked on i need to add a main menu and make it look better if anyone wants to help, it would be really appreciated


if you would like to change the pieces by all means go ahead.

same goes for the audio

to run this make sure you have the latest version of pygame installed
run: 
pip install pygame 


upon runnin the game for the first time i often run into a error about not being able to find the black pawn, if this happends to you then just igore it and re run the file. and it should fix its self.
